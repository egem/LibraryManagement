## Postman Test Instructions

The main purpose of running the Postman tests is to validate the endpoints and the flow of the application. There are specific cases to be tested, and these can be extended in the future.

To run the Postman tests, execute the following command:

    $ npm run postman-tests

If you'd like to generate a report and store the results in the `tests/postman/api/test-suite/results` folder, you can run:

    $ npm run postman-tests-report
